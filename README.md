# Developed by Kiondra Mills

# Project Title
Like-O-Roma

# Brief Coding Challenge Description
Create a Like Service that accepts a photo identifier, user identifier, 
and returns back the number of likes for a photo. 

# My Solution Approach
Due the time constraints, instead of building a full stack application of 
which was my first thought process and approach, I decided to focus my 
efforts on developing a polished FrontEnd software solution as I wanted to 
briefly display my skills as a FrontEnd developer, although it has minimal 
features.   

# Technologies Used
React JS
Javascript
Html
CSS
Bootstrap
Fontawesome
Firebase (hosting)

# Project Challenges
Overall I just needed more time to develop and think through the solution as
a whole. This week was super busy with work and the kids school activities
so my time was very limited. 

# Future Development Thoughts
I initialy planning on developing the back end api using AWS Web API, Lambda, 
and DynomoDB. I believe that these technologies would help this application 
scale as it will be a serverless application. I also like that you can 
start using it for FREE:-)

# Future Possible Features
User Login 
Like a photo directly
Follow top photo tags
Photo Trend Reports
List of top 100 photos from top social media website.

# Testing
Since this was a Front End application, I don't currently have any testing
setup. Ideally, I would have unit test setup for the API endpoint and oauth. 
I would also have error handling with logs, which can be handled through
AWS.
